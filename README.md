# TrustpilotScraping
Example of scraping trustpilot reviews for a sustainable holiday company

This script scrapes reviews from Trustpilot, for a given company.

There is exploratory analysis of:
- Average ratings by location
- Days between experiences and reviews

There is topic modelling to identify themes

There is sentiment analysis to assign a positive/negative sentiment score to the review content. NB this performs much worse than the given review score.

There is keyword analysis to identify the most prevalent words and n-grams (pair combinations of words)

Data is then exported to a csv file, with a timestamp
